#### Overview

Rate limits are enforced for all third-party applications and services. This document is an overview of the rate limits themselves, as well as how they are enforced and best practices for handling the errors returned when a rate limit is reached.

Third-party applications are currently throttled to 5000 requests per hour. As this API continues to age, the rate limits may be updated to provide better performance to users

#### Rationale

As previously mentioned, the primary goal is to provide a responsive interface for developers and users to use when accessing the Pokémon TCG data. Since each request made to the API incurs a computational cost, it’s in the best interest of both the Pokémon TCG API and its developer partners that these costs be minimized to the greatest degree possible.

Rate limiting also helps third-party developers by encouraging them to build their integrations to make economical use of API requests.

Welcome to the Pokémon TCG API! You can use the API to access Pokémon TCG API endpoints, which can get information on cards and sets. All API access is performed over HTTPS and accessed from the `https://api.pokemontcg.io` domain.

To use the API endpoints, the format is as follows:

`https://api.pokemontcg.io/<version>/<resource>`

For example:

`https://api.pokemontcg.io/v1/cards`

There are multiple SDKs available to make it even easier to consume the API.
To chat with other developers and discuss the API and SDKs, check out the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dpsTCvg)!
